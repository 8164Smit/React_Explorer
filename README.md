# React State Demo

A small React app showing state management in Class Components vs Functional Components with Hooks. Two counters do the same task—displaying and increasing a number—but use different React approaches.

1️⃣ Class Component Counter

🏛 Old React style

⚙️ Uses constructor(), this.state, this.setState()

🔢 Displays a number

➕ Increases on button click

⏱ Updates instantly without reload

2️⃣ Functional Component Counter

⚡ Modern React with Hooks

⚙️ Uses useState(), useEffect()

🔢 Shows a number and increases it on click

📝 Logs changes to console

✅ Recommended for new React apps

🎨 Styling

🎨 Colored buttons

✨ Clean, centered layout

🖋 Clear and readable text

🎯 Purpose

🔄 Compare Class Components vs Hooks

📚 Understand state in old vs modern React

💡 Helps beginners learn React patterns easily
